# Network Chat Application

This project is designed to assist novice network security researchers in understanding and learning how to implement TCP and UDP protocols to establish a direct chat between two devices without an intermediary. It serves as a crucial component of learning practical networking and information security, as it necessitates a thorough understanding of communication protocols and their distinctions.

## Features

### Protocol Implementation
- Demonstrates the implementation of TCP and UDP protocols for establishing direct device-to-device communication.

### Network Programming
- Explores network programming principles, including port binding and data transmission via TCP and UDP.

### Information Security
- Addresses various aspects of information security, such as protection against network attacks, safeguarding against eavesdropping, and ensuring data confidentiality.

### Analysis and Debugging
- Utilizes powerful tools like Wireshark for network traffic analysis and debugging, facilitating optimal performance and troubleshooting.
