# Network Chat Application

This project is designed to assist novice network security researchers in understanding and learning how to implement TCP and UDP protocols to establish a direct chat between two devices without an intermediary. It serves as a crucial component of learning practical networking and information security, as it necessitates a thorough understanding of communication protocols and their distinctions.

## Features

### Protocol Implementation
- Demonstrates the implementation of TCP and UDP protocols for establishing direct device-to-device communication.

### Network Programming
- Explores network programming principles, including port binding and data transmission via TCP and UDP.

### Information Security
- Addresses various aspects of information security, such as protection against network attacks, safeguarding against eavesdropping, and ensuring data confidentiality.

### Analysis and Debugging
- Utilizes powerful tools like Wireshark for network traffic analysis and debugging, facilitating optimal performance and troubleshooting.

- # Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install and run the Chat application:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amine10a/chat
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
    ```bash
    cd chat
    ```
3. **Running the **:
  ```bash
    python chat_udp.py
    or
    python chat_tcp.py
    
  ```
You must run scripts in two different windows in local host, or you can change the IP and run it in two different machines.
